# python--challenge
# python-challenge is made up of two parts, PyBank and PyPoll, each of which have their own folders.
# Within each folder are the following files: a) a file called main.py, the main script to run for each analysis, b)a Resources folder that
# contains the CSV files used in the analysis, and c) an analysis folder containing a text file with the results of the analysis.

# The purpose of the PyBank challenge is to create a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company. Given a financial dataset #called budget_data.csv, composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses", the goal is to calculate these values:

# 1) The total number of months included in the dataset

# 2) The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

# 3) The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

# 4) The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

#5) The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

# In addition, the script should print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
#
#
# In the PyPoll challenge, the task is to help a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.
# Given a set of poll data called election_data.csv,composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate", analyze the votes and calculates each of the following values:

# 1) The total number of votes cast

# 2) a complete list of candidates who received votes

# 3) the percentage of votes each candidate won
